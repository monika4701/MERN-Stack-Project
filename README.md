Gitgram seeks to develop a web portal, to be able to link the developers. 
It will be a platform for the developers and freelancers to showcase their works around the world to be able to view the profiles. 
A platform only for the web developers to interact and communicate with each other and contribute in each otherâ€™s work and projects. 
Using this portal, it will become easy for the developers and students to take a glance of others developers project ideas.
